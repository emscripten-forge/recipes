  description: |
    The ncurses (new curses) library is a free software
    emulation of curses in System V Release 4.0 (SVr4),
    and more. It uses terminfo format, supports pads and
    color and multiple highlights and forms characters and
    function-key mapping, and has all the other SVr4-curses
    enhancements over BSD curses. SVr4 curses is better
    known today as X/Open Curses

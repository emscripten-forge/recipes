  summary: |
    The CppInterOp library provides a minimalist approach for other languages
    to interoperate with C++ entities.
  description: |
    CppInterOp exposes API from Clang and LLVM in a backward compatibe way.
    The API support downstream tools that utilize interactive C++ by using
    the compiler as a service. That is, embed Clang and LLVM as a libraries
    in their codebases. The API are designed to be minimalistic and aid
    non-trivial tasks such as language interoperability on the fly. In such
    scenarios CppInterOp can be used to provide the necessary introspection
    information to the other side helping the language cross talk.

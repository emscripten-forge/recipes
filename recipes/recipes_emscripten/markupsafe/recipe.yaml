  summary: Safely add untrusted strings to HTML/XML markup.
  description: |
    MarkupSafe implements a text object that escapes characters so it is
    safe to use in HTML and XML. Characters that have special meanings are
    replaced so that they display as the actual characters. This mitigates
    injection attacks, meaning untrusted user input can safely be displayed
    on a page.

  summary: |
    Regular expression pattern matching using Perl 5 syntax and semantics.
  description: |
    The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular expression
    pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl 5. PCRE has its
    own native API, as well as a set of wrapper functions that correspond to the
    POSIX regular expression API. The PCRE library is free, even for building
    proprietary software.

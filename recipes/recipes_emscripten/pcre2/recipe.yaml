  summary: Regular expression pattern matching using Perl 5 syntax and 
    semantics.
  description: |
    The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular expression pattern matching
    using the same syntax and semantics as Perl 5. PCRE has its own native API, as well as a set of
    wrapper functions that correspond to the POSIX regular expression API. The PCRE library is
    free, even for building proprietary software.

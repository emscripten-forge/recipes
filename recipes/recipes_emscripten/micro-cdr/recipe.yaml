  summary: |
    Micro CDR is a C library implementing the serialization mechanism defined in the DDS-XRCE protocol.
  description: |
    Micro CDR is a minimal C serialization library designed for resource-constrained systems.
    It is used by eProsima's Micro XRCE-DDS to encode and decode CDR (Common Data Representation)
    data structures, supporting both little and big endian architectures and multiple data types.
    This library is lightweight, portable, and particularly suited for embedded systems and microcontrollers.

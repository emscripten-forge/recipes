  summary: Arrays of numbers for Python, optimized for small sizes
  description: |
    Tinyarrays are similar to NumPy arrays, but optimized for small sizes.
    Common operations on very small arrays are to 3-7 times faster than
    with NumPy (with NumPy 1.6 it used to be up to 35 times), and 3 times
    less memory is used to store them. Tinyarrays are useful if you need
    many small arrays of numbers, and cannot combine them into a few
    large ones.

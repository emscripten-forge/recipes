  summary: Ruby Interface for C++ Extensions
  description: |
    Rice is a C++ header-only library that serves dual purposes. First, it makes
    it much easier to create Ruby bindings for existing C++ libraries. Second,
    it provides an object oriented interface to Ruby's C API that makes it easy
    to embed Ruby and write Ruby extensions in C++.

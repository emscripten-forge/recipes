  summary: Extremely Fast Compression algorithm
  description: |
    LZ4 is lossless compression algorithm, providing compression speed at 400
    MB/s per core (0.16 Bytes/cycle). It features an extremely fast decoder,
    with speed in multiple GB/s per core (0.71 Bytes/cycle). A high compression
    derivative, called LZ4_HC, is available, trading customizable CPU time for
    compression ratio. LZ4 library is provided as open source software using a
    BSD license.

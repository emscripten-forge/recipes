  summary: Make Dealing with Dates a Little Easier
  description: |
    Functions to work with date-times and time-spans: fast and user friendly
    parsing of date-time data, extraction and updating of components of a date-
    time (years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds), algebraic
    manipulation on date-time and time-span objects. The 'lubridate' package has
    a consistent and memorable syntax that makes working with dates easy and
    fun.

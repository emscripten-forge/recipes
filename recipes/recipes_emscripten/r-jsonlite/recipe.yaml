  summary:  A Simple and Robust JSON Parser and Generator for R
  description: |
    A reasonably fast JSON parser and generator, optimized for statistical data
    and the web. Offers simple, flexible tools for working with JSON in R, and
    is particularly powerful for building pipelines and interacting with a web
    API. The implementation is based on the mapping described in the vignette
    (Ooms, 2014). In addition to converting JSON data from/to R objects,
    'jsonlite' contains functions to stream, validate, and prettify JSON data.
    The unit tests included with the package verify that all edge cases are
    encoded and decoded consistently for use with dynamic data in systems and
    applications.

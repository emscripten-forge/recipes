ADB_DEVICE=serial_number:
  serial_number specifies the device to deploy the built apk to if multiple
  Android devices are connected to the host.
BUILD=0:
  Disables the build of the package.
DEPLOY=0:
  Disables the deployment of the built apk to the Android device.
RUN_DEBUGGER=1:
  Launches the application in gdb after it has been deployed.  To debug in
  gdb, NDK_DEBUG=1 must also be specified on the command line to build a
  debug apk.
LAUNCH=0:
  Disable the launch of the apk on the Android device.
SWIG_BIN=swig_binary_directory:
  The directory where the SWIG binary lives. No need to set this if SWIG is
  installed and point to from your PATH variable.
SWIG_LIB=swig_include_directory:
  The directory where SWIG shared include files are, usually obtainable from
  commandline with \"swig -swiglib\". No need to set this if SWIG is installed
  and point to from your PATH variable.
ndk-build arguments...:
  Additional arguments for ndk-build.  See ndk-build -h for more information.

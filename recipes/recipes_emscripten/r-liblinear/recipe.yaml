  summary: A wrapper around the LIBLINEAR C/C++ library for machine learning (available at <https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/>).
    LIBLINEAR is a simple library for solving large-scale regularized linear classification
    and regression. It currently supports L2-regularized classification (such as logistic
    regression, L2-loss linear SVM and L1-loss linear SVM) as well as L1-regularized
    classification (such as L2-loss linear SVM and logistic regression) and L2-regularized
    support vector regression (with L1- or L2-loss). The main features of LiblineaR
    include multi-class classification (one-vs-the rest, and Crammer & Singer method),
    cross validation for model selection, probability estimates (logistic regression
    only) or weights for unbalanced data. The estimation of the models is particularly
    fast as compared to other libraries.

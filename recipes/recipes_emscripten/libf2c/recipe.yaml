  # We still download the full CLAPACK but we are only using the libf2c part of CLAPACK.
  # libf2c part is needed for the f2ced Fortran files in scipy for example to
  # define things like pow_dd, i_len, etc...
  #
  # Note f2clib package only creates f2clib.a, and f2clib.a symbols are added to
  # libopenblas.so in the OpenBLAS meta.yaml.

  summary: 'passagemath: Graphs, posets, hypergraphs, designs, abstract complexes, combinatorial polyhedra, abelian sandpiles, quivers'
  description: |
    Distribution of a part of the Sage library.
    It provides directed and undirected graphs, but also posets, combinatorial designs,
    abstract simplicial complexes, quivers, etc.  It consists of over 170 first-party Python
    and Cython modules and uses the Boost Graph Library, with additional functionality from
    NetworkX and several other libraries.

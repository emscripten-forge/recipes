  summary: |
    Eclipse zenoh for pico devices - A lightweight C implementation of the Zenoh protocol
    for constrained devices and microcontrollers
  description: |
    zenoh-pico is the Eclipse zenoh implementation that targets constrained devices,
    offering a native C API. It is fully compatible with its main Rust Zenoh implementation,
    providing a lightweight implementation of most functionalities.
    
    zenoh (pronounce /zeno/) unifies data in motion, data at rest and computations.
    It carefully blends traditional pub/sub with geo-distributed storages, queries and
    computations, while retaining a level of time and space efficiency that is well
    beyond any of the mainstream stacks.
    
    zenoh-pico supports various platforms including Unix, Zephyr, Arduino, ESP-IDF,
    MbedOS, FreeRTOS, and Raspberry Pi Pico, with transport protocols including
    UDP (unicast and multicast), TCP, Serial, WebSocket, and more.

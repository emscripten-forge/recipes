  summary: Fast and Portable Character String Processing Facilities
  description: |
    Fast, correct, consistent, portable, as well as convenient character string/
    text processing in every locale and any native encoding. Owing to the use of
    the ICU (International Components for Unicode) library, the package provides
    R users with platform-independent functions known to Java, Perl, Python,
    PHP, and Ruby programmers. Available features include: pattern searching,
    random string generation, case mapping, string transliteration,
    concatenation, Unicode normalization, date-time formatting and parsing,
    and many more.

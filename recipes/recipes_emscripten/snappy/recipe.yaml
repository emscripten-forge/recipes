  summary: A fast compressor/decompressor
  description: |
    Snappy is a compression/decompression library. It does not aim for maximum
    compression, or compatibility with any other compression library; instead,
    it aims for very high speeds and reasonable compression. Snappy is used
    in many Google projects including BigTable, MapReduce and other systems.

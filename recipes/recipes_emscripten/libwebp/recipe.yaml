  summary: WebP image library
  description: >
    WebP is a method of lossy and lossless compression that can be used on a large
    variety of photographic, translucent and graphical images found on the web. The
    degree of lossy compression is adjustable so a user can choose the trade-off between
    file size and image quality. libwebp-base provides the headers and shared libraries.
    For cwebp and dwep, binaries install libwebp.

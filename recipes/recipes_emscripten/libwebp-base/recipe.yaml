  summary: WebP image library
  description: >
    WebP is a method of lossy and lossless compression that can be used on a
    large variety of photographic, translucent and graphical images found on the
    web. The degree of lossy compression is adjustable so a user can choose the
    trade-off between file size and image quality.
    libwebp-base provides the headers and shared libraries. For cwebp and dwep,
    binaries install libwebp.

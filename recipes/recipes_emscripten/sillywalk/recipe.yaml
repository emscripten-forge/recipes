  summary: 'Library for maximum likelihood principal component analysis for AnyBody models'
  description: |
    sillywalk is a Python library for statistical modeling of human motion and
    anthropometric data with the AnyBody Modeling System. It implements Maximum
    Likelihood Principal Component Analysis (ML-PCA) to learn compact,
    low-dimensional models from datasets, predict missing or individualized
    signals from partial inputs, and export those predictions as AnyScript
    include files that plug directly into AnyBody models.

  summary: Interrupt and signal handling for Cython
  description: |
    When writing Cython code, special care must be taken to ensure that the code
    can be interrupted with CTRL-C. Since Cython optimizes for speed, Cython
    normally does not check for interrupts. For example, code like the following
    cannot be interrupted in Cython:

    cdef long i
    for i in range(2^63):
        if i > 2^60:
            print i

    The cysignals package provides mechanisms to handle interrupts (and other
    signals and errors) in Cython code.

    Parameters
    ----------
    url : str
        The URL to hash.
    timeout : int, optional
        The timeout in seconds. If the operation goes longer than
        this amount, the hash will be returned as None. Set to `None`
        for no timeout.
    progress : bool, optional
        If True, show a simple progress meter.
    hash_type : str
        The kind of hash. Must be an attribute of `hashlib`.

    Returns
    -------
    hash : str or None
        The hash, possibly None if the operation timed out or the url does
        not exist.

# Introduction


Emscripten-forge is a GitHub [organization](https://github.com/emscripten-forge)/[repository](https://github.com/emscripten-forge/recipes) containing  [conda recipes](https://github.com/emscripten-forge/recipes) for the `emscripten-wasm32` platform.
Conda-forge does not (yet) support the `emscripten-wasm32` platform. `emscripten-forge` fills this gap by providing a channel with conda packages for the `emscripten-wasm32` platform.
The recipe repository not only stores the recipe, but also builds and upload the recipe 
with github actions to the `emscripten-forge` channel on [quetz](https://beta.mamba.pm/channels/emscripten-forge)
